\title{
get.permu to generate permutation results for calculation of empirical P values for
each enhancer-gene linkage.
}
\description{
get.permu is a function to use the same statistic model to calculate random enhancer-gene
pairs. Based on the permutation value, empirical P value can be calculated for the
real enhancer-gene pair (see reference).
}
\usage{
get.permu(mee, geneID, percentage = 0.2, rm.probes = NULL, permu.size = 1000, 
permu.dir = NULL, cores = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{mee}{
A MEE.data object contains at least meth, exp, probeInfo, geneInfo.
}
  \item{geneID}{
A vector lists gene id which need to be have permutation.
}
  \item{percentage}{
A number ranges from 0 to 1 specifying the percentage of samples of control and experimental
groups used to link probes to genes. Default is 0.2.
}
  \item{rm.probes}{
A vector lists name of probes which belongs to the set of probes fed into \code{\link{get.pair}}
function.
}
  \item{permu.size}{
A number specifies the number of permuation. Default is 1000.
}
  \item{permu.dir}{
A path shows the directory of permutation outputs
}
  \item{cores}{
A interger which defines the number of cores to be used in parallel process.
Default is NULL: no parallel process.
}
}

\value{
Certain number of permutation for each gene of interets.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...

\note{
Permutation is the most time consuming step. It is recommended to use multiple 
cores for this step. Default permutation time is 1000 which may need 12 hrs by 4 cores. 
However 10,000 permutations is recommended to get high confidence results. But it 
may cost 2 days.
